# Corrdinates to .kml Generator
GUI application to generate .kml shapes from NOTAM coordinates

# Directions:
Select either "Polygon" or "Circle".

## To generate circles:
1) Enter the name for the activity area. This also doubles as the name of the .kml file.
2) Enter the coordinates. The coordinates have to be in degree-minutes-seconds notation, i.e."xxyyz.zzN xxxyyz.zzW".
3) Enter the radius of the activity area in meters.
4) Click "generate kml" to create the /kml file in the same folder as the application.
5) Click "Reset" to remove existing points and generate a new .kml file.

## To generate polygons:
1) Enter the name for the activity area. This also doubles as the name of the .kml file.
2) Enter the first set of coordinates. The coordinates have to be in degree-minutes-seconds notation, i.e."xxyyz.zzN xxxyyz.zzW".
3) Click "add point", the coordinate will show up in the list of current points.
4) Add the remaining coordinates.
5) Click "generate kml" to create the /kml file in the same folder as the application.
6) Click "Reset" to remove existing points and generate a new .kml file.
